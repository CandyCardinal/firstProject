    <h1> Introduction </h1>
    <p> Good day, everyone! This is a small project for my HTML 5 computer class, which is a part of my homeschooling curriculum.</p>
    <p> I hope you like birds, because I'll be informing you about northern cardinals. </p>
    <h1> Northern Cardinal Summary</h1>
    <p> Northern cardinals are mid-sized perching songbirds that are commonly found in the eastern half of the United States as well as many areas of Mexico.</p>
    <p> Northern cardinals are loved by many, probably due to the male's beautiful red coloration or pleasantly sounding songs.</p>
   <div id="appearance">
        <h1> Appearance </h1>   
       <p> Northern cardinals display sexual dimorphism. This means that male and female cardinals have morphological differences to each other (in other words, their characteristics that are not directly involved in reproduction appear differently within the two sexes). In this case, the male northern cardinal proudly boasts a beautifully red plumage around his body, with a patch of black feathers near his beak and eyes. A female northern cardinal has a light brown plumage, with red accents along her wings, tail, and crest.  </p>
       <p> Northern cardinals have short, thick bills. Their thick bills aid them in eating the foods they like.</p>
   </div> 
   <div id="diet">
        <h1> Diet </h1>   
     <p> Using their aforementioned short and thick bills, northern cardinals are able to eat a variety of seeds, grains and fruits. Corn, oats, and sunflower seeds are common food of northern cardinals. Northern cardinals are ground feeders and find food while hopping on the ground through trees or shrubbery. Including the seeds, grains, and fruits, northern cardinals may also eat snails and insects such as beetles, cicadas, and grasshoppers. A young cardinal's diet consists almost entirely of insects.</p> 
   </div>
   <div id="habitat">
    <h1> Habitat </h1>   
    <p>  Northern cardinals frequently appear in the eastern half of the United States, as well as many areas of Mexico, and, recently, even a few areas in Canada! Northern cardinals like to spend their time in woodland edges, thickets, suburban gardens, towns, and desert washes. These birds are very easy to find, commonly appearing whenever there are some dense bushes for nesting.  </p>
